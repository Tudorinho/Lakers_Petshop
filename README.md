# Lakers_Petshop
Lakers_Petshop is a collaborative Java project developed by me and my college colleague Antonio. It's an object-oriented pet shop application with features like pet management, inventory tracking and search functionality. Our goal was to create an efficient and user-friendly experience for pet shop owners, employees, and customers.
